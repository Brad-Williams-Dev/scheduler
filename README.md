# Interview Scheduler

This project was a deep-dive into using the react library / framework. We learned a lot of key concepts in react such as JSX,
useState, useEffect and creating our own custom hooks. We also got a lot of testing experience during this project using Jest and Cypress.

The core design / CSS was provided to us as a template, but overall was a great project in practicing modular coding and full-stack development!
